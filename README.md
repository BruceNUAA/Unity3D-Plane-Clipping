# Unity3D-Plane-Clipping
Plane clipping shaders for Unity3D 5.3.2+. Extends the Standard shader!

Now it works with the specular setup as well!

## Usage

Attach the "ClippableObject" script to an object.

It will replace the material of the object with a "clippable" standard material.

If you'd like to reuse the properties of your material (as long as it's based from standard material) [this comment may be of help](https://github.com/toxicFork/Unity3D-Plane-Clipping/issues/2#issuecomment-291783757) !
